# claude-bot
A command line helper

## Install
Check out the project, then run `chmod +x install.sh ` and then `./install.sh`. Requires an Anthropic API token, which you need to `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-<foo>` into your environment.

## Run
Run `claude`. It will ask what you want to do, and then you can either run, get an explanation, or not. Type `exit` to leave the tool.
